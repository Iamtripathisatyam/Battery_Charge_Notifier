# Use of **`plyer`** Module:
```python
       1. Used as a Desktop Notifier. 
       2. It produces a Notification Message in form of a POP-UP Message on Desktop.
```
# Use of **`time`** Module:
```python
       1. This Module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. 
       2. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
